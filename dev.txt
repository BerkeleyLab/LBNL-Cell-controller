Cell Controller marble porting development notes

Badger/BWUDP:
  Default IP address: 192.168.20.20
  Source: [epics.c]
    static const ipv4Address defaultIP = {{192, 168, 20, 20}};
  Default UDP Port: 50006
  Source: [cellControllerProtocol.h]
    #define CC_PROTOCOL_UDP_PORT        50006

Aurora clocks:
  Line rate: Appears to be 3.125 Gb/s (why that number?)
  F_GTREFCLK can be many discrete values from 125 MHz to 625 MHz
    What's the trade-off?
  For marble, I have two options:
    1. Set F_GTREFCLK to 125MHz and use FPGA_REF_CLK0
    2. Generate any other frequency with SI570
  Option 1 sounds easiest.  Any reason why I shouldn't do that?

  After an incredibly annoying bug squash, I was able to change the aurora
  refclk freq to 125 MHz (from 312.5 MHz) and successfully build.  In the
  absence of any compelling reasoning to the contrary, I'm going to attempt
  to require as few different input clock frequencies as possible.
  On the latest (successful) build,
    Included:
      forwardData
      evrSync
      evr_mgt_top_i
      evrLogger
      readBPMlinks
      forwardCellLink
      fofbReadLinks
      linkStatistics
      fofbDSP
    Excluded:
      qsfpReadout
      psSetpointMonitor
      psAWG
      psMUX
      psTx
      psRx
      fofbRecorder
      eebi
      errorConvert

  For the qsfpReadout, I need to add an additional transaction to set the
  configuration of the I2C mux (U5, TCA9548) to select the desired QSFP
  (they can have the same I2C address, so must only enable one channel at
  a time).

  Ethernet is working now.  I had a few bugs to squash.
  1. Assert PHY_RSTN at top level (I guess it was defaulting to low).
  (now it should ping)
  2. Register service with bwudp using htons(PORT) rather than just PORT
  (now it should respond to packets)
  3. Fix the byte order of sscanf in software/tests/protocolTest.c
  (now we can send a test packet and parse the response)

  Next I'd like to re-introduce some of the modules I excluded from the last
  synthesis and see if I can still build.  If I can introduce modules in the
  smallest increments I should be able to maintain a tractable understanding
  of the clock interactions and the required 

  I also need to figure out the clock situation.

230612:
  First try ethernet is dead.  After setting up route on the lappy, I see the
  lights on the switch blinking on the host side, but not on the marble side.
  Also get no response and no chatter.  Can't ping either.
  Also the marble_mmc MDIO dump is returning all 0xFFFF on all registers.
  I have never experimented with this function, but that can't be accurate.

  Debug steps:
    1. Verify xdc file with schematic (everything going where it needs to?)
    2. Drop in chipscope/ila or scrap memory to log rxd pin activity
    3. Fix the MDIO issue and query those registers
    4. Get some FMC breakout to put the GMII pins on a scope
