Cell Controller marble porting development notes

Badger/BWUDP:
  Default IP address: 192.168.20.20
  Source: [epics.c]
    static const ipv4Address defaultIP = {{192, 168, 20, 20}};
  Default UDP Port: 50006
  Source: [cellControllerProtocol.h]
    #define CC_PROTOCOL_UDP_PORT        50006

  Ethernet is working now.  I had a few bugs to squash.
  1. Assert PHY_RSTN at top level (I guess it was defaulting to low).
  (now it should ping)
  2. Register service with bwudp using htons(PORT) rather than just PORT
  (now it should respond to packets)
  3. Fix the byte order of sscanf in software/tests/protocolTest.c
  (now we can send a test packet and parse the response)

  First try ethernet is dead.  After setting up route on the lappy, I see the
  lights on the switch blinking on the host side, but not on the marble side.
  Also get no response and no chatter.  Can't ping either.
  Also the marble_mmc MDIO dump is returning all 0xFFFF on all registers.
  I have never experimented with this function, but that can't be accurate.

  Debug steps:
    1. Verify xdc file with schematic (everything going where it needs to?)
    2. Drop in chipscope/ila or scrap memory to log rxd pin activity
    3. Fix the MDIO issue and query those registers
    4. Get some FMC breakout to put the GMII pins on a scope
