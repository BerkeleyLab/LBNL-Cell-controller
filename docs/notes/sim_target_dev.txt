Development notes for cell-controller firmware and software
Keith Penney picking up codebase from Eric Norum

230926:
  I have merged my Verilator top model with the sim platform which implements a lot
  of the FOFB mechanism.  Interaction with the live model is via 3 interfaces:
    1. EPICS ("copper") UDP link talks the "Cell Controller Protocol" just as the hardware does.
    2. stdin/stdout in the model provides the same interface as the UART terminal
    3. Stream Mux UDP link simulates traffic between the Aurora networks.

  To add to model:
    1. Simulated EVR traffic (controls FAstrobe)

  To add to external stimulus:
    1. Parameterized daemonic traffic generator
       * Implement with EVR traffic generator to simulate at the "FAstrobe" level
    2. Connect to EPICS IOC
    3. Run the setup scripts at model start

  I'm going to try to spin up a simulated platform (native-compiled) version of the
  software, normally intended for the microblaze.
